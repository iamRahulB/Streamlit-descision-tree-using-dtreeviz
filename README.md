# Decision Tree Classifier with Streamlit

This project presents a Decision Tree Classifier implemented using Streamlit, an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

## Project Description

The Decision Tree Classifier in this project is designed to provide an interactive user interface for exploring and visualizing decision trees. Users can select various parameters and observe the resulting decision tree graph using the `dtreeviz` library. The app allows customization of criteria (GIN or Entropy), splitter type (Best or Random), maximum depth, minimum sample split, minimum sample leaf, maximum features, maximum leaf nodes, minimum impurity decrease, and more.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface for selecting decision tree parameters and visualizing the resulting tree.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can customize various parameters for the Decision Tree Classifier, including the criterion (GIN or Entropy), splitter type (Best or Random), maximum depth, minimum sample split, minimum sample leaf, maximum features, maximum leaf nodes, minimum impurity decrease, etc.

- **Visualization:** The `dtreeviz` library is used to plot the decision tree graph, allowing users to observe how the tree makes decisions based on the selected parameters.

## How to Use
1. **Fork or Clone the Project:**
   ```
     git clone https://github.com/iamRahulB/Streamlit-descision-tree-using-dtreeviz.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```
   cd Streamlit-descision-tree-using-dtreeviz
   ```
3. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   1. On Windows:
     ```
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   2. On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
5. Install the Required Dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Run the Application Locally Using Streamlit:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
